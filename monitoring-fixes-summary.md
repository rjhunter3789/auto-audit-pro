# Monitoring System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ScrapingDog Stats Not Showing in Admin Settings

**Problem**: The ScrapingDog usage statistics were not persisting or displaying properly in the Admin Settings API Usage section.

**Solution**:
- Modified `lib/scrapingdog-wrapper.js` to persist stats to `data/monitoring/scrapingdog-stats.json`
- Added `loadStats()` and `saveStats()` methods to the ScrapingDogWrapper class
- Stats are now saved after every request (success or failure)
- Enhanced the admin settings page to display more detailed stats:
  - Total requests
  - Successful requests
  - Failed requests  
  - Success rate
  - Average cost per request
  - Last updated timestamp
- Added a refresh button and auto-refresh every 30 seconds

### 2. SSL Detection False Negatives

**Problem**: SSL certificate checks were incorrectly marking valid certificates as invalid, especially for sites behind CDNs like Cloudflare.

**Solution**:
- Improved SSL detection logic in `lib/monitoring-engine.js`:
  - Increased timeout from 5 to 10 seconds
  - Added SNI (Server Name Indication) support
  - Better error handling for CDN-protected sites
  - More intelligent error code interpretation
  - Now assumes SSL is valid for sites that block direct certificate inspection
  - Added certificate issuer and subject information to results

### 3. Inventory Detection Failures (Pierre Ford)

**Problem**: The monitoring system was incorrectly reporting 0 inventory for dealerships that actually have vehicles listed.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote inventory detection in `lib/monitoring-engine.js`:
  - Added comprehensive pattern matching for inventory links
  - Searches for multiple inventory-related keywords
  - Detects Vehicle Detail Page (VDP) links
  - Parses inventory count from page text
  - More lenient detection to avoid false negatives
  - Only flags as critical if NO inventory indicators are found
  - Distinguishes between "no inventory section" and "empty inventory"

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring Stats Tracking

**Problem**: ScrapingDog usage wasn't being properly tracked in the monitoring engine.

**Solution**:
- Modified `lib/monitoring-engine.js` to save stats immediately after each ScrapingDog request
- Stats are persisted to both:
  - `data/monitoring/stats.json` (general monitoring stats)
  - `data/monitoring/scrapingdog-stats.json` (detailed ScrapingDog usage)

## Testing

A test script has been created at `test-monitoring-fixes.js` that verifies:
1. ScrapingDog stats tracking
2. API endpoint functionality
3. SSL detection accuracy
4. Inventory detection accuracy
5. Full monitoring check functionality

To run the tests:
```bash
node test-monitoring-fixes.js
```

## API Endpoint

The `/api/monitoring/stats` endpoint now returns:
```json
{
  "seleniumRequests": 0,
  "scrapingDogRequests": 8,
  "seleniumSuccess": 0,
  "scrapingDogSuccess": 8,
  "scrapingDogStats": {
    "totalRequests": 8,
    "successfulRequests": 8,
    "failedRequests": 0,
    "totalCost": 0.008,
    "savedBySelenium": 0,
    "successRate": "100.00%",
    "averageCost": "$0.0010",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-07-22T18:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "seleniumSuccessRate": "0%",

    "avg_response_time": 1250
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-07-22T18:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `lib/monitoring-engine.js` - Enhanced SSL detection, inventory detection, and stats tracking
2. `lib/scrapingdog-wrapper.js` - Added persistent stats storage
3. `views/admin-settings.html` - Enhanced API usage display with more details and auto-refresh
4. `test-monitoring-fixes.js` - New test script to verify all fixes
5. `monitoring-fixes-summary.md` - This documentation file

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the system for a few hours to ensure stats are accumulating correctly
2. Test with various dealership websites to verify inventory detection accuracy
3. Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging
4. May want to add email alerts when ScrapingDog usage exceeds certain thresholds
