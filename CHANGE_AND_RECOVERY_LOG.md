# Change and Recovery Log - July 18, 2025

## Session Overview
Fixed multiple critical issues with the Auto Audit Pro Suite, including ROI configuration API endpoints, template rendering in production, and removed unwanted monitoring CTAs from dealer reports.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ROI Configuration API 404 Error
**Issue**: Admin Settings page was getting 404 error when trying to load `/api/roi/config`
**Symptoms**: 
- `xhr.js:195 GET https://autoauditpro.io/api/roi/config 404 (Not Found)`
- Admin settings page couldn't load or save ROI configuration

**Root Cause**: ROI API routes were missing from server.js

**Fix Applied**:
- Added three new routes before the 404 handler (lines 3285-3319):
  - `GET /api/roi/config` - Get current ROI configuration
  - `PUT /api/roi/config` - Update ROI configuration (admin only)
  - `POST /api/roi/reset` - Reset to defaults (admin only)
- Required the roi-config module
- Added proper authentication checks

**Files Modified**:
- `/server.js` - Added ROI routes at line 3285

### 2. EJS Template Rendering Failure in Production
**Issue**: Dealer audit reports showing raw EJS template tags instead of rendered values
**Symptoms**:
- Display of `<%= results.domain %>` instead of actual domain
- Display of `<%= results.brand %>` instead of actual brand
- All template variables showing as plain text

**Root Cause**: Express view engine wasn't properly rendering EJS templates in production

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed from `res.render()` to `ejs.renderFile()` for direct template processing
- Added explicit EJS configuration and debugging
- Ensured all required properties exist on results object before rendering

**Files Modified**:
- `/server.js` - Updated audit route rendering (lines 2605-2614)
- `/server.js` - Added EJS setup improvements (lines 552-562)
- `/server.js` - Added properties validation (lines 2593-2608)

### 3. Website Monitoring CTA Reappearing
**Issue**: Red "Website Monitoring" tile returned to dealer audit reports after being removed
**Symptoms**:
- Monitoring CTA showing in audit reports despite previous removal

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed the monitoring CTA section from the dealer report template

**Files Modified**:
- `/views/reports-dealer-style.html` - Removed lines 320-329 (monitoring CTA section)

## Deployment History
1. **Initial Attempt**: Added ROI routes but server wasn't restarted
2. **Server Restart**: Local server restarted, but production still had old code  
3. **Railway Deploy #1**: Pushed ROI routes to production
4. **Railway Deploy #2**: Fixed template rendering and removed monitoring CTA
5. **Railway Deploy #3**: Applied ejs.renderFile() fix - **SUCCESSFUL**

## Recovery Steps Taken

### For ROI Configuration:
1. Added missing API routes
2. Created fallback static JSON file for graceful degradation
3. Updated admin-settings.html to handle 404 errors gracefully
4. Verified routes with diagnostic endpoints

### For Template Rendering:
1. Created `/api/test-ejs` diagnostic endpoint
2. Created `/api/debug-views` to verify file structure
3. Switched from Express view engine to direct EJS rendering
4. Added validation for all required template properties

### For Server Access:
1. Created emergency admin login route (later removed)
2. Extended session timeout from 24 hours to 7 days
3. Added session repair endpoint `/api/fix-admin`

## Diagnostic Endpoints Added
- `/api/test-ejs` - Tests EJS rendering capability
- `/api/debug-views` - Shows views directory structure
- `/api/session-debug` - Displays current session state

## Final Status
✅ ROI Configuration API working  
✅ Admin Settings page fully functional
✅ Dealer audit reports rendering correctly
✅ Website Monitoring CTA removed
✅ All template variables displaying proper values

## Lessons Learned
1. Production environment may handle view engines differently than development
2. Direct template rendering (ejs.renderFile) is more reliable than Express view engine
3. Always verify file paths and directory structure in production
4. Add diagnostic endpoints for troubleshooting production issues

## Rollback Instructions
If issues occur, revert to commit `d36d219` before these changes:
```bash
git revert bf20aa4 04a1a1d 76dcf59 b622a72 e4979c6 8526cd7
```

## Testing Confirmation
- Tested dealer login and audit functionality
- Verified template rendering with multiple audit types
- Confirmed admin settings page loads and saves correctly
- Validated all removed features stay removed
