## Troubleshooting

### Dealer Group Analysis Issues

#### Group Tests Showing "No clear... found"
- **Cause**: Detection patterns may not match site structure or sites blocking automation
- **Solution**: Enhanced detection patterns and added debugging
- **Debug**: Check console output for HTML content and link analysis

### Website Blocking Issues
- Many sites use Cloudflare or similar protection
- Enhanced Chrome options added to reduce detection
- Try demo/test sites if production sites are blocked
