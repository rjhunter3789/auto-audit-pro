## Recovery Scenarios

### 1. Admin Access Issues (RESOLVED)

**If Admin Settings shows "Access Denied":**
1. Login as admin (admin / AutoAudit2025!)
2. Visit: http://localhost:3002/api/fix-admin-session
3. Then access: http://localhost:3002/admin/monitoring-settings

**Alternative Admin Settings Access:**
- Use: http://localhost:3002/settings-config (bypasses /admin/ route issues)

### 2. Report Display Issues (Template Errors)

**Current Issue**: Reports show raw template code like `<%= results.domain %>`

**Temporary Workarounds:**
1. View raw audit data: http://localhost:3002/api/audit/[AUDIT-ID]
2. Use monitoring dashboard for website status
3. Check browser console (F12) for specific errors

**Permanent Fix Needed**: Convert report files from .html to .ejs or fix client-side JavaScript

### 3. Multi-User System

**Files Added:**
- `lib/user-manager.js` - User authentication system
- `data/users.json` - User database
- `server-login-update.js` - New login code reference

**To Enable Multi-User:**
1. Add to server.js: `const { authenticateUser } = require('./lib/user-manager');`
2. Replace login route with code from server-login-update.js
3. Restart server

**To Rollback Multi-User:**
1. Keep existing login code in server.js
2. System continues using .env credentials only

### 4. CSP (Content Security Policy) Fix

**Changed in server.js:**
```javascript
// Old:
"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net; "

// New (allows html2canvas for PDF export):
"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com; "
```

### 5. Permission Model Changes

**Dealer Controls** (in Lead Performance Settings):
- ROI calculations
- Business metrics
- Expected improvements

**Admin Only Controls**:
- Monitoring frequency (30 min, 59 min, 6 hours)
- User management (when implemented)
- System configuration

### 6. Removed Features

**Monitoring Tile Removed From:**
- Website Analysis page (index-new.html)
- Now only on main suite homepage

### 7. Monitoring Dashboard Fixes (January 17, 2025 - Evening)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Dashboard showing "Checking..." instead of actual timestamps
- Alert acknowledge/resolve buttons not working
- 500 errors on API calls

**What Was Changed:**
1. Updated `/api/monitoring/status` endpoint to use JSON storage
2. Updated `/api/monitoring/profiles` endpoint to use JSON storage  
3. Fixed acknowledge alert endpoint (`/api/monitoring/alerts/:alertId/acknowledge`)
4. Fixed resolve alert endpoint (`/api/monitoring/alerts/:alertId/resolve`)
5. Changed from `new JSONStorage()` to `require('./lib/json-storage').storage`

**Files Modified:**
- `server.js` - Multiple endpoint updates
- Created fix scripts: `fix-monitoring-status-display.js`, `fix-all-monitoring-endpoints.js`, `fix-json-storage-usage.js`

### 8. Multi-User System Enabled (January 17, 2025 - Late Evening)

**Login Credentials:**
- Admin: username `admin`, password `AutoAudit2025!`
- Dealer: username `dealer`, password `dealer123`

**Fixed Issues:**
- fs.existsSync error - changed `fs.promises` to separate `fs` and `fsPromises`
- Added debug logging to troubleshoot login issues
- Created `data/users.json` with both admin and dealer accounts

**UI Enhancements:**
- Added password visibility toggle (eye icon) on login page
- Click eye to show/hide password while typing

**Role-Based Features Working:**
- Admin sees: Red "Admin" badge, Admin Settings button, Delete buttons
- Dealer sees: Clean interface without admin controls
- Dealers cannot delete monitoring profiles (by design)

### 9. Profile Deletion Fixed (July 18, 2025)

**Previous Issue:**
- Delete button showed "Failed to delete monitoring profile"
- Error: `TypeError: jsonStorage.saveProfiles is not a function`

**Root Cause:**
- json-storage.js module didn't have saveProfiles/saveAlerts/saveResults methods
- Code was trying to call non-existent functions

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed to use direct file writes with fs.writeFile()
- Delete endpoint now writes directly to JSON files
- All profile/alert/result data properly cleaned up on delete

**Files Modified:**
- `server.js` - Updated delete endpoint, alerts endpoint, stats endpoint
- Now uses: `await fs.writeFile(profilesFile, JSON.stringify(updatedProfiles, null, 2))`

### 10. Phantom Monitoring Fixed (July 18, 2025)

**Previous Issue:**
- Deleted profiles continued to be monitored
- Price Ford kept reappearing even after deletion
- Monitoring scheduler was using PostgreSQL instead of JSON

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated MonitoringScheduler to use JSON storage
- Removed all PostgreSQL queries from scheduler
- Created cleanup script for ghost profiles

**To Clean Ghost Profiles:**
```bash
node clean-phantom-profile.js
```

### 11. Admin Settings Access Fixed (July 18, 2025)

**Issue:**
- Admin Settings button returned 403 Forbidden
- requireAdmin middleware blocking even admin users

**Fix Applied:**
- Created alternative route `/settings-admin`
- Properly restricted to admin users only
- Added session repair endpoint

**If Admin Access Denied:**
1. Visit: `/api/fix-admin`
2. This will repair your admin session
3. Then Admin Settings will work

## Emergency Rollback Commands

### Full System Reset
```bash
# Stop server
# Restore from backup
git checkout HEAD -- .
# Or specific files
git checkout HEAD -- server.js
git checkout HEAD -- views/index-new.html

# Restart
npm start
```

### Session Issues
```bash
# Clear all sessions
rm -rf sessions/
# Restart server
npm start
```

### User System Issues
```bash
# Reset to admin only
rm data/users.json
# Server auto-creates with admin from .env
npm start
```

## July 19, 2025 - Major Fixes Applied

### 1. Admin Settings 403 Error - FIXED
**Issue**: Persistent 403 errors when accessing Admin Settings, even when logged in as admin
**Root Cause**: 
- Views folder was being blocked by middleware
- Global auth middleware position blocking admin routes
- Admin routes placed after global auth check

**Solution**:
- Changed views blocking to static file serving
- Moved admin routes BEFORE global auth middleware (critical!)
- Updated admin button to use direct path: `/views/admin-settings.html`
- Disabled JavaScript 403 redirect in admin-settings.html

**Files Changed**:
- `server.js` - Lines 79-82 (views access)
- `server.js` - Admin routes moved before line 347
- `views/monitoring-dashboard.html` - Admin button href
- `views/admin-settings.html` - Added default config population

### 2. Active Alerts Display - FIXED
**Issue**: Active Alerts showed no alerts even with RED/YELLOW conditions
**Root Cause**: 
- Alert deduplication not working
- Stats counting duplicates
- Mixed database/JSON storage

**Solution**:
- Fixed updateStats() to use uniqueAlerts array
- Proper alert grouping - one per type with highest severity
- All monitoring now uses JSON storage exclusively

**Files Changed**:
- `views/monitoring-dashboard.html` - updateStats function
- `server.js` - Monitoring endpoints converted to JSON

### 3. Phantom Monitoring - FIXED
**Issue**: Deleted profiles (Price Ford) continued being monitored
**Root Cause**: Monitoring scheduler still using PostgreSQL queries

**Solution**:
- Updated checkRecentAlert() to use JSON storage
- Updated updateLastCheck() to use JSON storage
- Monitoring engine now properly saves to JSON

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/monitoring-scheduler.js` - Database queries replaced
- `lib/monitoring-engine.js` - Added JSON storage

### Emergency Access Methods
If locked out with 403 errors:
1. Direct HTML: `/views/admin-settings.html`
2. Emergency route: `/settings-admin`
3. Repair session: `/api/fix-admin`

### Critical Middleware Order
**IMPORTANT**: In server.js, admin routes MUST come before:
```javascript
app.use(checkAuth); // Line ~347
```

Any routes after this line require authentication!

## July 24, 2025 - Production Deployment & Access Denied Resolution

### 1. ScrapingDog Disabled
**Request**: User requested complete removal of ScrapingDog monitoring
**Changes Made**:
- Modified `lib/monitoring-engine.js` to disable all ScrapingDog functionality
- Set `this.scrapingDog = null` in constructor
- Removed all fallback logic for 403 errors
- Sites with Cloudflare/anti-bot now show as unreachable (expected behavior)

### 2. Persistent "Access Denied" Issue Investigation
**Problem**: Every navigation from Admin Settings resulted in "Access Denied" screen
**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Security middleware blocking `/admin` paths
2. User confusion between env admin and users.json admin
3. Session persistence issues
4. Authentication middleware ordering

**Fixes Applied**:
- Removed `/admin` from suspicious paths in security middleware
- Updated session configuration for better persistence (7 days, rolling sessions)
- Changed "Back to Main" button to "Back to Monitoring"
- Added `/recover-access` emergency endpoint

### 3. User System Confusion Fix
**Issue**: Two "admin" users with same credentials causing conflicts
**Solution**: 
- Temporarily cleared users.json to use only env admin
- Modified login to prioritize environment admin
- Later restored original multi-user setup per user request

### 4. Production Deployment Issues
**Problems**: 
- Health check failures ("service unavailable")
- CSP blocking JavaScript execution
- Missing API endpoints in production

**Solutions Created**:
- Created `server-prod.js` with simplified dependencies
- Created `server-minimal.js` for guaranteed deployment
- Added flexible CSP configuration
- Created diagnostic pages for CSP issues

### 5. Final Resolution
**User Decision**: Return to original setup with security intact
**Current State**:
- Multi-user system restored (admin + dealer accounts)
- Authentication required for all access
- Dealer can test without admin privileges
- Deployment configured to use `server-simple.js`

## July 22, 2025 - Critical Production Fixes

### 1. Access Denied Errors - FIXED
**Issue**: All app pages returning "Access Denied" (Admin Settings, Monitoring, Lead Analysis)
**Root Cause**: 
- Auth middleware incorrectly blocking critical API routes
- Session info endpoint being blocked before session could be checked
- ROI config endpoint blocked preventing app initialization

**Solution**:
- Added exclusions for `/api/roi/config` GET requests
- Added exclusion for `/api/session-info` endpoint
- Created emergency session fix endpoint `/api/emergency-fix-session`
- Moved critical endpoints before auth middleware

**Files Changed**:
- `server.js` - Auth middleware exclusions added
- Created emergency session repair route

### 2. Missing Monitoring Profiles - FIXED
**Issue**: RED alerts not displaying, monitoring profiles missing from dashboard
**User Impact**: "Where are my critical alerts?!"
**Root Cause**: 
- Profiles existed in alerts.json but not in profiles.json
- Dashboard only reads from profiles.json
- Orphaned data from incomplete deletion/sync issues

**Solution**:
- Created `recover-profiles.js` recovery script
- Recovered Fugate Ford and Mullinax Ford profiles from orphaned alerts
- Script matches alerts to profiles and rebuilds missing data
- Fixed dashboard to properly display all critical alerts

**Files Changed**:
- Created `recover-profiles.js` - Profile recovery utility
- `data/profiles.json` - Recovered missing profiles

### 3. Deleted Profiles Reappearing - FIXED
**Issue**: Deleted dealer profiles kept coming back
**User Frustration**: "This thing is fucking broken" - exact quote
**Root Cause**: 
- Backup system creating backups BEFORE writes
- If write failed, old backup would be restored
- Created endless loop of restoration

**Solution**:
- Fixed backup timing in `json-storage.js`
- Now creates backups AFTER successful writes only
- Backup only on successful operation completion
- No more zombie profiles

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/json-storage.js` - Fixed backup timing logic
- Backup now happens post-write, not pre-write

### 4. Complete Profile Deletion - FIXED
**Issue**: Delete button not removing all associated data
**Expected**: Delete should remove profiles, alerts, and monitoring results
**Root Cause**: 
- `deleteProfile` method was correct
- Backup system was restoring deleted data
- Issue was backup timing, not deletion logic

**Solution**:
- Created `remove-dealer-completely.js` for thorough deletion
- Script removes from profiles.json, alerts.json, and results.json
- Provides clean removal without restoration issues
- Confirmed original deleteProfile method works correctly

**Files Changed**:
- Created `remove-dealer-completely.js` - Complete removal utility
- Verified `lib/json-storage.js` - deleteProfile method correct

### Emergency Recovery Tools Created
1. **Session Recovery**: `/api/emergency-fix-session`
   - Repairs broken admin sessions
   - Bypasses auth for emergency access

2. **Profile Recovery**: `node recover-profiles.js`
   - Recovers orphaned profiles from alerts
   - Rebuilds missing monitoring data

3. **Complete Removal**: `node remove-dealer-completely.js [dealerName]`
   - Thoroughly removes all dealer data
   - Prevents restoration from backups

### Critical Lessons Learned
- **Backup Timing Matters**: Always backup AFTER successful operations
- **Auth Middleware Order**: Critical endpoints must be excluded or placed before auth
- **User Frustration**: When users say "fucking broken," it's a backup/restore issue
- **Data Consistency**: Profiles and alerts must stay synchronized
