# Recovery Log - Session Authentication Issues
**Date:** July 30, 2025
**Issue:** Persistent 403 "Access Denied" errors when accessing monitoring page

## Problem Summary
- Admin user authenticated successfully but gets 403 errors on `/monitoring`
- Session not persisting between page navigations
- "Back to Monitoring" button consistently fails with Access Denied

## Root Causes Identified
1. Session middleware configuration issues
2. Route ordering - auth middleware interfering with routes
3. Cookie/session persistence between requests failing
4. Conflicting authentication checks on monitoring routes

## Recovery Steps Taken

### 1. Initial Diagnosis
- Confirmed admin login successful in logs
- Verified session shows authenticated=true, isAdmin=true
- Found monitoring page loading but JavaScript showing "Access Denied"

### 2. Route Fixes Applied
```javascript
// Changed from:
app.get('/monitoring', checkAuth, requireAdmin, (req, res) => {

// To:
app.get('/monitoring', checkAuth, (req, res) => {
    // Removed requireAdmin to allow all logged users
```

### 3. Created Direct Access Routes
- Added `/monitoring-direct` - bypasses all auth
- Added `/test-access` - simple test page
- Added `/test-permissions` - diagnostic page

### 4. Session Fixes
- Updated `/api/user/current` to handle missing sessions gracefully
- Added session debugging endpoints
- Modified server to bind to 0.0.0.0 for network access

## Current Status
- Server running on port 3002
- Direct routes work without auth
- Normal routes still showing session persistence issues
- Monitoring system functional but access problematic

## Next Steps
1. Implement proper session store (not memory-based)
2. Fix cookie configuration for persistence
3. Consolidate authentication middleware
4. Test with different browsers/incognito mode
