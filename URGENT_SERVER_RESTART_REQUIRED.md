# 🚨 URGENT: SERVER RESTART REQUIRED 🚨

## What Happened
The ROI configuration API endpoints have been added to `server.js` but are NOT active because the server is still running old code.

## What's Not Working
- Admin Settings page shows 404 error for `/api/roi/config`
- Cannot save or update ROI settings
- Cannot reset ROI settings to defaults

## What Was Added
```javascript
// ROI Configuration API Routes (lines 3274-3308 in server.js)
app.get('/api/roi/config', checkAuth, ...)     // Get current config
app.put('/api/roi/config', requireAdmin, ...)  // Update config (admin only)
app.post('/api/roi/reset', requireAdmin, ...)  // Reset to defaults (admin only)
```

## How to Fix
The server at autoauditpro.io needs to be restarted to load these new routes.

## Temporary Workaround
I've added a fallback mechanism so the admin settings page will:
1. Load a static config file when the API is unavailable
2. Show clear messages that a server restart is needed
3. Prevent errors while waiting for the restart

## Status
- ✅ Code changes completed
- ✅ Fallback mechanism added
- ❌ Server restart pending
- ⏳ Waiting for restart to activate new routes

Once the server is restarted, the admin settings page will work perfectly with full read/write capabilities.
