FIX ACCESS DENIED - STEP BY STEP
================================

Please follow these steps EXACTLY:

1. First, check your session status. Open this URL:
   http://localhost:3002/api/session-info
   
   COPY AND PASTE THE RESULT HERE - it should show something like:
   {
     "authenticated": true/false,
     "username": "admin",
     "role": "admin",
     "isAdmin": true/false,
     "sessionID": "...",
     "userObject": {...}
   }

2. If authenticated is false, you need to login first:
   http://localhost:3002/login
   Username: admin
   Password: AutoAudit2025!

3. After login, immediately visit:
   http://localhost:3002/api/fix-admin-session
   
   You should see:
   {"success":true,"message":"Admin session fixed","session":{"username":"admin","role":"admin","isAdmin":true}}

4. Check your session again:
   http://localhost:3002/api/session-info
   
   Now isAdmin should be true

5. Finally try admin settings:
   http://localhost:3002/admin/settings

IMPORTANT: Sessions can expire or get cleared. If you:
- Restart the server
- Clear browser cookies
- Use a different browser
- Wait too long

You'll need to login and fix the session again.

CHECK SERVER CONSOLE:
Look at your terminal where the server is running. When you try to access admin settings, you should see:
[RequireAdmin] Checking admin access: {...}
[RequireAdmin] Access denied

This will tell us exactly why access is being denied.
