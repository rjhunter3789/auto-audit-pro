### 2. Updated Report Templates
Updated three main report templates to include the new PDF styles:

- `/views/reports.html` (Lead performance reports)
- `/views/reports-group.html` (Group analysis reports)

### 3. Added Page Break Controls
- Section headers now force page breaks to avoid mid-section splits
- Issue items and recommendations use "keep-together" classes
- Category grids and metric rows won't split across pages
- Images and tables are protected from breaking

### 4. Enhanced Report Structure

- Improved section organization for better flow
- Hidden non-essential elements (buttons, navigation) in print

## Key CSS Classes Added

### Page Break Controls
- `.section-break` - Forces a new page before the element
- `.keep-together` - Prevents element from splitting across pages
- `.issues-section` - Special handling for issues lists

### Print-Only Elements
- `.cover-page` - Professional cover page for PDFs
- `.print-header` - Header information on each page
- `.no-print` - Elements hidden during printing

## Print Media Optimizations

1. **Typography**: Adjusted font sizes for print (11pt base)
2. **Colors**: Print-friendly color adjustments
3. **Layout**: Grid layouts optimized for Letter/A4 paper
4. **Spacing**: Professional margins and padding
5. **Page Flow**: Orphan/widow controls for better text flow
