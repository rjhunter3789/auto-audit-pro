# Recovery Instructions - Dealer Group Analysis Issues

## Current Status (Updated: January 11, 2025)

### Issues We Were Working On:
1. **Health Score Bug** - FIXED ✅
   - Was showing 348/100 due to weight calculation error
   - Fixed by changing weight from 15 to 0.15 and adding normalization

2. **"window is not defined" Error** - FIXED ✅
   - Fixed by removing browser-specific code from group-analysis.js
   - Updated classifyDealerLink function to use Node.js URL parsing

3. **Group Analysis Detection Issues** - MOSTLY FIXED ✅
   - Was: All tests returning "No clear... found"
   - Now: Detecting 172 locations, 25 brands, full group info!
   - Minor refinements needed for Contact Methods and Navigation
   - Debug logging added and working

4. **Quick Audit Only for Groups** - CONFIRMED AS INTENTIONAL ✅
   - Not a bug - designed to restrict groups to quick audit
   - Server supports comprehensive but UI restricts it

### Files Modified:
1. `/server.js` - Fixed scoring calculation, enhanced Chrome options
2. `/lib/group-analysis.js` - Fixed window error, improved detection patterns, added debugging
3. `/AUTO-AUDIT-PRO.md` - Added dealer group documentation
4. `/CHANGELOG.md` - Documented new features and fixes

## To Resume Where We Left Off:

### 1. Check Current Git Status
```bash
git status
```

### 2. Key Areas to Review:

#### A. Group Analysis Detection (Main Issue)
The group analysis tests are failing to detect elements. We added debugging in:
- `lib/group-analysis.js` lines 92-114 (main debug output)
- `lib/group-analysis.js` lines 147-148 (location test debug)

#### B. Recent Improvements Made:
- Comprehensive brand list with variations (lines 12-60)
- Expanded GROUP_PATTERNS (lines 63-83)
- Enhanced testLocationDirectory function (lines 141-248)
- Improved testBrandRepresentation function (lines 249-367)
- Better testContactConsistency function (lines 434-587)
- Enhanced testNavigationStructure function (lines 589-708)
- Improved testGroupInformation function (lines 371-497)

### 3. Latest Test Results:
- **Tested site**: geeautomotive.com
- **Results**: SUCCESSFUL! 
  - 172 locations found
  - 25 brands detected
  - Full group information detected
  - Group Structure: 4/5 (Excellent)

### 4. Remaining Minor Issues:
1. **Contact Methods**: Still showing "Limited contact options"
2. **Navigation Structure**: Still showing "Basic navigation"
3. **Debug statements**: Still active in the code (remove when stable)

### 4. Test Commands:
```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Test a dealer group site
# Navigate to http://localhost:3002
# Enter a dealer group URL like kendallautogroup.com
```

### 5. Common Dealer Group Sites to Test:
- kendallautogroup.com
- autonation.com
- lithia.com
- Group1auto.com
- sonicautomotive.com

## Debugging Output to Look For:

When you run the audit, check the console for:
```
[Group Analysis Debug] URL: [site-url]
[Group Analysis Debug] Has body tag: [true/false]
[Group Analysis Debug] HTML length: [number]
[Group Analysis Debug] Body text length: [number]
[Group Analysis Debug] Number of links: [number]
[Group Analysis Debug] First 5 links:
  1. Text: "[link-text]", Href: "[link-href]"
  ...
```

This will tell us:
- If HTML is being loaded properly
- What the actual page structure looks like
- Why our selectors might not be matching

## If You Need to Revert Changes:
```bash
# See all recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Revert to before changes if needed
git reset --hard [commit-hash]
```

## Key Insights So Far:
1. Many dealer group sites block automated tools (Cloudflare, etc.)
2. The improved patterns are working well - detecting locations and brands successfully
3. Quick Audit restriction for groups is intentional, not a bug
4. The enhanced selectors and brand list made a huge difference
5. Debug output is helpful for understanding what's being detected
