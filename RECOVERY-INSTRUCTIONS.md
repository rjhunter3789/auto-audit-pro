## To Resume Where We Left Off:

### 1. Check Current Git Status
```bash
git status
```

### 2. Key Areas to Review:

#### A. Group Analysis Detection (Main Issue)
The group analysis tests are failing to detect elements. We added debugging in:
- `lib/group-analysis.js` lines 92-114 (main debug output)
- `lib/group-analysis.js` lines 147-148 (location test debug)

#### B. Recent Improvements Made:
- Comprehensive brand list with variations (lines 12-60)
- Expanded GROUP_PATTERNS (lines 63-83)
- Enhanced testLocationDirectory function (lines 141-248)

- Better testContactConsistency function (lines 434-587)
- Enhanced testNavigationStructure function (lines 589-708)
- Improved testGroupInformation function (lines 371-497)

### 3. Latest Test Results:
- **Tested sites**: geeautomotive.com, kendallautogroup.com

  - 25+ brands detected correctly
  - Full group information detected
  - Group Structure: 4/5 (Excellent)
  - Contact Methods: Now detecting 80+ phone numbers
  - Navigation: Comprehensive detection

### 4. All Major Issues RESOLVED ✅:
1. **Health Score 348/100** - FIXED (proper weight calculation)
2. **"window is not defined"** - FIXED (removed browser-specific code)
3. **Group detection failing** - FIXED (improved patterns working)
4. **Location count inflated** - FIXED (more selective counting)
5. **Chrome session errors** - FIXED (added retry logic)
6. **Quick Audit only** - CONFIRMED as intentional
7. **Specialty locations missing** - FIXED (added motorcycle, commercial, service centers)
8. **Large dealer groups undercounted** - FIXED (new LocationCrawler module)
   - AutoNation was showing 39/325 (12%)
   - Now uses web crawling for comprehensive discovery

### 4. Test Commands:
```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# Test a dealer group site
# Navigate to http://localhost:3002
# Enter a dealer group URL like kendallautogroup.com
```

### 5. Common Dealer Group Sites to Test:
- kendallautogroup.com
- autonation.com
- lithia.com
- Group1auto.com
- sonicautomotive.com

## Debugging Output to Look For:

When you run the audit, check the console for:
```
[Group Analysis Debug] URL: [site-url]
[Group Analysis Debug] Has body tag: [true/false]
[Group Analysis Debug] HTML length: [number]
[Group Analysis Debug] Body text length: [number]
[Group Analysis Debug] Number of links: [number]
[Group Analysis Debug] First 5 links:
  1. Text: "[link-text]", Href: "[link-href]"
  ...
```

This will tell us:
- If HTML is being loaded properly
- What the actual page structure looks like
- Why our selectors might not be matching

## If You Need to Revert Changes:
```bash
# See all recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Revert to before changes if needed
git reset --hard [commit-hash]
```

## Latest Code Changes (July 11, 2025):

### Location Count Fix:
- Unified `testLocationDirectory` and `extractDealerLinks` to use same logic
- Removed overly broad selectors like `a[href*=".com"]`

### Web Crawler Implementation:
- Created new LocationCrawler module for comprehensive discovery
- Implements multiple discovery methods:
  - XML sitemap parsing
  - Known location page patterns
  - API endpoint discovery
  - Deep crawling with pagination
  - Selenium for JavaScript content
- Should detect 80-100% of locations for major dealer groups

### Combined Insights Improvements:
- Fixed "Download Full Report" button - now generates comprehensive PDF report
- Removed misleading "Fix Website Issues" CTA
- Fixed mobile experience reporting:
  - Only shows as issue if mobile score is actually poor
  - No longer implies 65% mobile traffic is a problem
- Replaced confusing radar chart with clear grouped bar chart:
  - Side-by-side comparison (purple vs green bars)
  - Easy to see performance gaps
  - Professional and matches app branding

### Dealer Group Web Search Implementation:
- Created DealerSearcher module for finding actual dealer counts
- Integrated web search when "Dealer Group" is selected
- Shows actual vs website-visible location counts
- Known dealer groups database:
  - AutoNation (325), Lithia (300), Group 1 (263)
  - Penske (203), Asbury (200), Sonic (140)
  - Ken Garff (70), Gee (43), Kendall (30)
- Improved data clarity in reports:
  - "X locations found on website" vs "Actually has Y locations"
  - Shows percentage of locations not discoverable
  - Warning alerts when major discrepancies exist

## Key Insights:
1. Dealer groups often use external sites (e.g., kendallford.com)
2. Need specific patterns for each group's structure
3. Quick Audit restriction is intentional for performance
4. Location counting must be precise to avoid inflated numbers
5. Chrome sessions need retry logic for stability
