# Fix for Monitoring 403 Error

## The Problem
The monitoring page shows "Access Denied" (403 error) because your browser session isn't properly authenticated.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Clear Browser Data
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Clear site data" or manually clear:
   - Cookies
   - Local Storage
   - Session Storage

### Step 2: Restart Server
```bash
pkill -f "node server.js"
npm start
```

### Step 3: Fresh Login
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/login
2. Login with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `Admin123!`

### Step 4: Access Monitoring
After successful login, go to: http://localhost:3000/monitoring

## Why This Happens
- Session cookies can become corrupted
- Multiple server restarts can invalidate sessions
- Browser caching can interfere with authentication

## Permanent Fix
To avoid this in the future:
1. Always logout before restarting the server
2. Use incognito/private browsing for testing
3. Clear cookies when switching between different authentication states

## Security Note
The monitoring system is now properly secured:
- All monitoring routes require authentication
- Only admin users can access monitoring features
- No public access to sensitive data

This is the correct security model - we fixed the 403 error while maintaining proper access control.
