# VPS Setup and Changes Log
Date: August 1, 2025

## VPS Migration from Railway/Render to DigitalOcean

### Problem Summary
- Persistent "Access Denied" (403) errors on Railway deployment
- Same issues occurred on Render deployment after initial success
- Root cause: Our own security middleware was blocking access

### VPS Setup Process

#### 1. DigitalOcean Droplet Creation
- **Provider**: DigitalOcean
- **Plan**: Basic $6/month (1GB RAM, 25GB SSD, 1TB transfer)
- **Region**: San Francisco
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **IP Address**: 146.190.39.214

#### 2. Initial Server Configuration
```bash
# System updates
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Node.js installation
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash -
apt install -y nodejs

# Additional tools
apt install -y git nginx npm
```

#### 3. Application Deployment
```bash
# Clone repository
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/rjhunter3789/auto-audit-pro.git

# Install dependencies
cd auto-audit-pro
npm install

# Create .env file with necessary environment variables
nano .env
```

#### 4. Process Management Setup
```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start application
pm2 start server.js --name auto-audit
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

#### 5. Nginx Configuration
Created `/etc/nginx/sites-available/autoauditpro`:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name autoauditpro.io www.autoauditpro.io;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3002;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

#### 6. SSL Certificate Setup
```bash
# Install Certbot
apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Obtain SSL certificate
certbot --nginx -d autoauditpro.io -d www.autoauditpro.io
```

#### 7. DNS Configuration
- Updated DNS A records to point to 146.190.39.214
- Removed old Railway CNAME records

### Critical Issues Resolved

#### 1. Security Middleware Blocking Access
**Problem**: The security monitor middleware was treating all visitors as intruders
**Solution**: Commented out the aggressive security check in server.js:
```javascript
// app.use(checkSuspiciousActivity);
```

#### 2. Authentication Re-enabled
After fixing access issues, properly re-enabled authentication:
- Restored proper checkAuth middleware
- Fixed requireAdmin function
- Added admin credentials to .env file

#### 3. Missing Chromium Installation
**Problem**: Selenium tests were failing with "Chrome not reachable"
**Solution**: 
```bash
apt install -y chromium-browser chromium-chromedriver
```

### Today's Dealer Groups Investigation
1. Temporarily re-enabled dealer groups feature
2. Fixed JavaScript syntax errors in views/index-new.html
3. Enhanced error handling in lib/selenium-wrapper.js
4. Tested multiple dealer groups:
   - Small/medium groups work well
   - Large corporate groups are blocked
   - Location detection accuracy ~30-40%
5. Re-disabled feature due to reliability issues

### Current Status
- ✅ Application running on VPS at https://autoauditpro.io
- ✅ SSL certificate active and auto-renewing
- ✅ Authentication properly configured
- ✅ All features working except dealer groups
- ✅ No more "Access Denied" errors
- ✅ Full control over server environment

### Benefits of VPS
1. No platform restrictions or arbitrary blocking
2. Full control over security policies
3. Can run multiple applications
4. Cost-effective ($6/month)
5. Better performance and reliability

### Next Steps
1. Deploy smart-document-assistant to same VPS
2. Cancel Railway subscription
3. Consider implementing monitoring/backup solutions
4. Future: Improve dealer groups feature with Google Maps API
