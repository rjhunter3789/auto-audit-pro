- **7 directories** created for better organization
- **.gitignore** updated to prevent future clutter
- **Utility scripts** documented for clarity

### 📁 New Directory Structure

```
_dev/
├── backups/           # Old backup files and directories
│   ├── data-backups/  # JSON backup files from data/
│   └── views_backup/  # Complete backup of views directory
├── debug-scripts/     # Debug and test scripts
├── temp-files/        # Temporary text files and commands
└── voice-debug/       # Voice-related debug HTML files
```

### 🧹 What Was Cleaned

1. **Debug/Test Files** (19 files)
   - Test scripts, fix scripts, debug utilities
   - Moved to `_dev/debug-scripts/`

2. **Shell Scripts** (10 files)
   - One-off fix scripts for various issues
   - Moved to `_dev/debug-scripts/`

3. **Text Command Files** (12 files)
   - Temporary notes and command references
   - Moved to `_dev/temp-files/`

4. **Backup Files** (8+ files)
   - JSON backups with timestamps
   - Moved to `_dev/backups/data-backups/`

5. **Voice Debug Files** (6 files)
   - Voice interface test HTML files
   - Moved to `_dev/voice-debug/`

6. **Complete Backup Directory**
   - `views_backup/` with 32 files
   - Moved to `_dev/backups/views_backup/`

### 📝 Remaining Utility Scripts

These scripts remain in the root directory as they serve production purposes:

- **create-copyright-zip.sh** - Creates copyright registration packages
- **start.sh** - Production startup script
- **create-web-search.py** - Web search functionality
- **manage-users.js** - User management utility
- **cleanup-dev-files.js** - This cleanup script (can be removed after use)

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review _dev Directory**
   ```bash
   ls -la _dev/
   ```

2. **Remove Cleanup Script** (optional)
   ```bash
   rm cleanup-dev-files.js
   rm CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: Clean up development files and organize project structure"
   ```

4. **Delete Unnecessary Files** (after review)
   ```bash
   # After reviewing what's truly not needed
   rm -rf _dev/temp-files/
   rm -rf _dev/voice-debug/
   ```

### 🎯 Benefits

- ✨ Cleaner project structure
- 📦 Production-ready codebase
- 🔍 Easier to navigate and maintain
- 🚀 Reduced deployment size
- 📝 Better documentation of utility scripts

### 🛡️ Prevention

The updated `.gitignore` now excludes:
- All files in `_dev/` directory
- Files matching patterns: `test-*`, `fix-*`, `*-test.*`, `*-fix.*`
- Backup files with `.backup` extension
- Voice debug HTML files
- Temporary text files (except important ones like README.txt)

This cleanup makes Auto Audit Pro more professional and maintainable!
