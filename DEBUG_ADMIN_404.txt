DEBUG ADMIN SETTINGS 404 ERROR
==============================

Please restart your server and then try these URLs in order:

1. Test if admin routes work at all:
   http://localhost:3002/admin/test
   
   Expected: JSON response with "Admin routes are working"
   If this gives 404, then no admin routes are working

2. Try the admin settings page:
   http://localhost:3002/admin/settings
   
   Check the server console for debug messages starting with [Admin Settings]

3. Also check the browser console (F12) for any errors

What I've done:
- Removed requireAdmin temporarily to rule out authentication issues
- Added debug logging to show the file path being used
- Added file existence check
- Created a test route to verify /admin/* routes work

If you still get 404:
- The server might not be loading the updated code
- Try completely stopping the server, waiting a few seconds, then starting again
- Make sure you saved all files

Alternative approach:
Try accessing the file directly through the static file server:
http://localhost:3002/views/admin-settings.html

(This won't have the proper authentication but will verify the file is accessible)
