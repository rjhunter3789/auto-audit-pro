FIX FOR MONITORING DASHBOARD 403 ERRORS
=======================================

The Issue:
----------
You're seeing 403 errors for URLs like:
- https://autoauditpro.io/api/monitoring/alerts/...
- https://autoauditpro.io/api/monitoring/stats

This means you're accessing the monitoring dashboard through the production domain (autoauditpro.io) 
instead of your local development server.

The Solution:
-------------
1. Make sure you're accessing the monitoring dashboard through localhost:
   http://localhost:3002/monitoring
   
   NOT through:
   https://autoauditpro.io/monitoring

2. If you're already using localhost and still seeing these errors, check your browser's 
   address bar to make sure it says "localhost:3002" and not "autoauditpro.io"

3. Clear your browser cache:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

4. If you need to access through autoauditpro.io domain, you would need to:
   - Deploy the application to that domain
   - Configure proper authentication on the production server
   - Set up SSL certificates

For Local Development:
---------------------
Always use: http://localhost:3002
This ensures all API calls go to your local server where your data is stored.

Quick Check:
-----------
Look at your browser's address bar right now. 
- If it shows "autoauditpro.io", that's the problem
- Change it to "localhost:3002" and reload the page
