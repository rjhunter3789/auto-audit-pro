# Website Monitoring System - "Check Engine Light" for Dealerships

## Original Idea (User)
"I have an idea, is it possible to setup fulltime dealership website monitoring that would identify any issues in realtime and notify the dealersip of these potential problems, kind of like a "check engine" light in your car. the notifications could be like RED = Urgent or Immediate Attention Need, Yellow = Potential problem but not requiring immediate attention and GREEN = Good To Go; this would monitor the website to identify potential problems, before they became a problem for the customer and ultimately the dealer, does this make sense?"

## System Overview

### Core Concept:
- **Continuous monitoring** of dealership websites
- **Traffic light alerts**: 游댮 RED (Critical), 游리 YELLOW (Warning), 游릭 GREEN (All Good)
- **Proactive notifications** before customers encounter issues
- **Real-time dashboard** showing website health

### Key Monitoring Areas:

**游댮 RED ALERTS (Immediate Action Required):**
- Website is down/unreachable
- SSL certificate expired
- Contact forms not working
- Phone numbers incorrect/disconnected
- Inventory feed broken (0 vehicles showing)
- Payment gateway errors
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Search functionality broken

**游리 YELLOW ALERTS (Attention Needed):**
- Page load time > 5 seconds
- SSL certificate expiring soon (< 30 days)
- Low inventory count (< 50 vehicles)
- Missing meta descriptions
- Broken internal links
- Mobile responsiveness issues
- Outdated specials/promotions
- Low lead conversion rate trend

**游릭 GREEN STATUS (All Systems Go):**
- All critical functions operational
- Performance metrics within targets
- Security checks passed
- Forms tested and working

### Implementation Architecture:

1. **Monitoring Engine**
   - Runs checks every 15-30 minutes
   - Uses existing audit infrastructure
   - Stores historical data for trends

2. **Notification System**
   - Email alerts
   - SMS for critical issues
   - Dashboard notifications
   - Weekly health reports

3. **Dashboard Features**
   - Real-time status display
   - Historical uptime graphs
   - Performance trends
   - Issue history log

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Monitoring Infrastructure
- Create monitoring database schema
- Build monitoring scheduler (cron-based)
- Implement core health checks
- Store monitoring results

### Phase 2: Alert System
- Define alert thresholds and rules
- Build notification engine (email/SMS)
- Create alert escalation logic
- Implement alert history tracking

### Phase 3: Dashboard & Reporting
- Build real-time monitoring dashboard
- Create historical trend visualizations
- Implement automated reporting
- Add dealer self-service features

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Predictive issue detection
- Competitor monitoring
- Performance benchmarking
- Custom alert configurations

## Database Schema (Proposed)

```sql
-- Monitoring Profiles
CREATE TABLE monitoring_profiles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    dealer_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    dealer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    website_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    monitoring_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    check_frequency INTEGER DEFAULT 30, -- minutes
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Monitoring Results
CREATE TABLE monitoring_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    profile_id INTEGER REFERENCES monitoring_profiles(id),
    check_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    overall_status VARCHAR(20), -- GREEN, YELLOW, RED
    uptime_status BOOLEAN,
    response_time_ms INTEGER,
    issues_found JSONB,
    metrics JSONB
);

-- Alert History
CREATE TABLE alert_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    profile_id INTEGER REFERENCES monitoring_profiles(id),
    alert_level VARCHAR(20), -- RED, YELLOW
    alert_type VARCHAR(100),
    alert_message TEXT,
    notification_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    acknowledged BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Alert Rules
CREATE TABLE alert_rules (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rule_name VARCHAR(255),
    check_type VARCHAR(100),
    threshold_value JSONB,
    alert_level VARCHAR(20),
    enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

## Example Alert Rules

### RED Alert Rules:
- Website returns 500/404 error
- SSL certificate invalid
- Contact form submission fails
- Main phone number not clickable
- Zero vehicles in inventory
- Homepage load time > 10 seconds

### YELLOW Alert Rules:
- Page load time 5-10 seconds
- SSL expires in < 30 days
- Inventory count < 50
- Missing H1 tags
- No meta description
- Mobile score < 70

## Benefits for Dealerships

1. **Proactive Problem Resolution**
   - Fix issues before customers encounter them
   - Reduce lost leads due to website problems

2. **Improved Customer Experience**
   - Ensure website is always functional
   - Maintain fast load times

3. **Increased Lead Capture**
   - Working forms = more leads
   - Better performance = higher conversion

4. **Peace of Mind**
   - 24/7 monitoring without manual checking
   - Immediate alerts for critical issues

5. **Historical Insights**
   - Track website health over time
   - Identify recurring issues
   - Measure improvement trends

## Next Steps
1. Review and refine the concept
2. Create detailed technical specifications
3. Build MVP with core monitoring features
4. Test with pilot dealerships
5. Iterate based on feedback
6. Full rollout with advanced features
