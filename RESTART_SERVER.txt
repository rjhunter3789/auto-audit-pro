RESTART THE SERVER TO APPLY CHANGES
===================================

The admin session fix worked! (You can see "success":true)

But the server needs to be restarted for the admin settings route fix to take effect.

Steps:
------
1. Go to your terminal where the server is running
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop it
3. Run: npm start
4. Wait for "Server running on port 3002"
5. Now try http://localhost:3002/admin/settings again

The "Not Found" error is happening because the server is still using the old code. 
A restart will load the fixed version where we changed from res.render() to res.sendFile().
