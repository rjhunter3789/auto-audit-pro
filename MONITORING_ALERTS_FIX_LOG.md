# Monitoring Alerts Fix Log
Date: August 1, 2025

## Issue Summary
Active Alerts section was showing "No active alerts" even though monitoring profiles were showing RED status.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Orphaned Alerts
- Initial investigation revealed alerts for old profile IDs that no longer existed
- Alerts were for profile 1753052736904 (deleted)
- Current profile 1754077296650 had no alerts

### 2. Missing Alert Rule
- Monitoring was getting 403 (Forbidden) responses
- System marked status as RED but no alert rule existed for 403 errors
- Only had rules for 500+ server errors, not 403 client errors

### 3. JSON Syntax Error
- Added new rule for 403 responses but introduced syntax error
- Trailing comma after last rule caused: "SyntaxError: Unexpected token ] in JSON at position 4204"
- This prevented ALL rules from loading, breaking the entire alert system

## Fix Implementation

### Step 1: Cleared Orphaned Alerts
```bash
echo "[]" > data/monitoring/alerts.json
```

### Step 2: Added 403 Alert Rule
Added to `/opt/auto-audit-pro/data/monitoring/rules.json`:
```json
{
  "id": 13,
  "rule_name": "Access Forbidden",
  "rule_category": "uptime",
  "check_type": "http_status_code",
  "condition": "equals",
  "threshold_value": 403,
  "alert_level": "RED",
  "alert_message_template": "CRITICAL: Website is blocking access (403 Forbidden) - visitors cannot reach the site!",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Step 3: Fixed JSON Syntax Error
- Removed trailing comma after last rule
- Validated JSON with: `python3 -m json.tool data/monitoring/rules.json`
- Restarted PM2 to reload corrected rules

## Verification
After fixes, manual monitoring check successfully created alert:
```json
{
  "id": 1754083644448,
  "profile_id": 1754077296650,
  "alert_level": "RED",
  "alert_type": "http_status_code",
  "alert_message": "CRITICAL: Website is blocking access (403 Forbidden) - visitors cannot reach the site!"
}
```

## Current Status
✅ Alert system functioning properly
✅ 403 errors now generate alerts
✅ Active Alerts section displays correctly
✅ RED status cards properly correlate with alerts

## Future Improvements Needed

### 1. Profile Deletion Cleanup
Need to modify DELETE endpoint to remove associated alerts:
```javascript
// When deleting profile, also clean up:
- Associated alerts
- Associated monitoring results
- Prevent orphaned data
```

### 2. Additional Alert Rules
Consider adding rules for:
- 401 Unauthorized
- 404 Not Found (if persistent)
- Timeout errors
- DNS resolution failures

### 3. Alert Management Features
- Bulk acknowledge/resolve
- Alert history view
- Alert frequency throttling
- Integration with notification system

## Lessons Learned
1. JSON syntax errors can silently break entire features
2. Always validate JSON after manual edits
3. Orphaned data needs cleanup mechanisms
4. Missing alert rules leave blind spots in monitoring
