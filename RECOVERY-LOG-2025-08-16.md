# Recovery and Change Log - August 16, 2025

## Session Summary
Completed standalone dealer lead analysis functionality, added comprehensive security features, and fixed critical bugs.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Standalone Dealer Lead Analysis - COMPLETE ✅
- **Issue**: Conversion rate showing 0% due to PA code format mismatch
- **Root Cause**: Selling Dealer column had "04417" but PA code was "F04417"
- **Fixed**: 
  - Added flexible PA code matching (handles F04417 vs 04417)
  - Strips Excel comment artifacts from cell values
  - Multiple format checks for dealer code matching

### 2. Response Time Calculation Fixed ✅
- **Issue**: Only showing "No Response" and "24hr+" categories
- **Root Cause 1**: Using wrong columns (was using F, should use F for actionable time)
- **Root Cause 2**: Couldn't parse "0h 13m" time format
- **Fixed**:
  - Now uses Column F (actionable time) to Column G (response time)
  - Added parser for "0h 13m" format
  - Fixed date parsing for "1/15/2025 10:30AM" format (no space before AM/PM)

### 3. Comprehensive Sales Metrics ✅
- **Added**: Your Conversion Rate, Lost to Competition Rate, Market Conversion Rate
- **Tracks**:
  - Your Sales (Selling Dealer = your PA code)
  - Lost Sales (Selling Dealer = "Other" or different code)
  - No Sale (no sale date)
- **Enhanced Charts**: Show Your Sales vs Lost Sales by lead source and type

### 4. Data Security Features ✅

#### Created Data Security Page (`/data-security`)
- Comprehensive explanation of privacy protections
- 100% client-side processing documentation
- Best practices for users
- Compliance information

#### Added Security Settings Panel
Both lead analysis pages now have:
- **Security Settings button** with modal dialog

- **Data Management**:

#### Auto-cleanup Features
- Data automatically cleared when browser closes (unless user opts out)
- 7-day expiration (can extend to 30 days)
- No customer PII ever sent to server

### 5. Security Monitoring Re-enabled ✅
- **Added**: Localhost/127.0.0.1 whitelist
- **Blocks**: Suspicious paths (wp-admin, .php, etc.)
- **Tracks**: Failed login attempts (3 strikes = 30 min block)
- **Logs**: All security events to /logs/security.log

### 6. Navigation Improvements ✅
- Network dealers page has "Single Dealer Analysis" button
- Standalone page has "Switch to Network Analysis" button
- Proper integration between both tools

### 7. Bug Fixes ✅
