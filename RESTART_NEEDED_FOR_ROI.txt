RESTART NEEDED - ROI CONFIG ROUTES ADDED
========================================

The ROI configuration API routes have been successfully added to server.js:

1. GET /api/roi/config - Returns current ROI configuration (requires authentication)
2. PUT /api/roi/config - Updates ROI configuration (admin only)  
3. POST /api/roi/reset - Resets configuration to defaults (admin only)

These routes are now in the code but the server needs to be restarted to load them.

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Added the missing ROI API routes that the admin settings page needs
- Routes are properly placed before the 404 handler
- Routes use appropriate authentication (checkAuth for GET, requireAdmin for PUT/POST)

HOW TO APPLY:
The server at autoauditpro.io needs to be restarted to load these new routes.

Once restarted, the admin settings page will work properly and no longer show the 404 error for /api/roi/config.
