SERVER RESTART STEPS FOR WINDOWS POWERSHELL
===========================================

The server is already running on port 3002. Follow these steps:

1. FIND THE EXISTING NODE PROCESS:
   In PowerShell, run:
   Get-Process node

2. STOP THE EXISTING SERVER:
   Option A - Kill all Node processes:
   Stop-Process -Name node -Force

   Option B - Find and kill specific process on port 3002:
   netstat -ano | findstr :3002
   (Note the PID in the last column)
   taskkill /PID [PID_NUMBER] /F

3. VERIFY IT'S STOPPED:
   Get-Process node
   (Should show no results or fewer processes)

4. START THE NEW SERVER:
   npm start

5. VERIFY IT'S RUNNING:
   You should see:
   "Auto Audit Pro Server v2.4.3 running on port 3002"

ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
If the above doesn't work, try:
1. Close ALL PowerShell/terminal windows
2. Open a fresh PowerShell window
3. cd C:\Users\nakap\Desktop\dealership-audit-mvp
4. npm start

The error "EADDRINUSE" means another process is using port 3002.
