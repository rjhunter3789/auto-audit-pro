QUICK FIX FOR 403 ERROR
======================

Follow these steps EXACTLY in order:

1. Make sure server is running (you should see "Server running on port 3002")

2. Open your browser and go to:
   http://localhost:3002/login

3. Login with:
   Username: admin
   Password: AutoAudit2025!

4. After login, IMMEDIATELY open a new tab and go to:
   http://localhost:3002/api/fix-admin-session

   You should see something like:
   {"success":true,"message":"Admin session fixed","session":{"username":"admin","role":"admin","isAdmin":true}}

5. Now try Admin Settings again:
   http://localhost:3002/admin/settings

If this doesn't work, try the Browser Console method:
----------------------------------------------
1. After logging in, press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Click on the "Console" tab
3. Copy and paste this ENTIRE block:

fetch('/api/fix-admin-session')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Fix result:', data);
    if(data.success) {
      alert('Admin access fixed! Redirecting...');
      window.location.href = '/admin/settings';
    } else {
      alert('Error: ' + JSON.stringify(data));
    }
  });

4. Press Enter
5. You should see an alert saying "Admin access fixed!" and be redirected

If STILL not working:
--------------------
Check the server console output. Look for lines that say:
[RequireAdmin] Checking admin access:
[RequireAdmin] Access denied

This will tell us what's wrong with the session.
