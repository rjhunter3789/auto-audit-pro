# Recovery and Change Log - August 15, 2025

## Issue: Lead Performance Upload Not Working

### Initial Problem
- File upload clicking did nothing
- Drag and drop sent files to browser downloads
- JavaScript error: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'leadSource' has already been declared"

### Changes Made on DigitalOcean Server

1. **Fixed duplicate leadSource declaration**
   - Line 576: Commented out duplicate `const leadSource = row[columnMap.leadSource] || 'Unknown';`
   - Command: `sed -i '576s/const leadSource/\/\/ const leadSource/' public/js/lead-performance.js`

2. **Fixed missing closing brace**
   - Added closing brace to end of file
   - Removed extra brace when it caused "Unexpected token" error

3. **Added missing function exports**
   - Added to window object:
     - window.initializeCharts
     - window.showUploadSuccess  
     - window.saveDataToStorage
     - window.uploadedDealerData

4. **Modified lead type filter**
   - Commented out filter that only allowed "Form" leads
   - Now processes all lead types (Form, Phone, Chat)

5. **Set currentDealer for standardized format**
   - Added `currentDealer = dealerName;` after detecting F08684 format

### Current Status
- File upload works and reads the file successfully
- Detects standardized format (F08684 in cell A1)
- But processes 0 dealers - data not being saved to uploadedDealerData

### Next Steps
- Debug why processing loop isn't running despite file being read
- Check for early return statements or breaks in code flow
- Consider reverting to backup and making changes more carefully
- Possible solution: Create separate single-dealer upload page

### Files Modified on Server
- `/opt/auto-audit-pro/public/js/lead-performance.js`
- `/opt/auto-audit-pro/views/lead-performance.html`

### Server Details
- DigitalOcean droplet: autoauditpro
- PM2 process manager
- Restarted multiple times with `pm2 restart all`

All changes were made directly on the production server, not committed to git yet.
