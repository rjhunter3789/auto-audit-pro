FORCE SERVER RESTART
====================

The routes aren't loading. Your server is still running the OLD code.

Do this:

1. Go to your terminal where the server is running
2. Press Ctrl+C TWICE (sometimes once isn't enough)
3. Make sure it says the server stopped
4. Wait 3 seconds
5. Run: npm start
6. Wait for "Server running on port 3002"
7. Try: http://localhost:3002/settings-config

If it STILL doesn't work after restart:

ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
1. Close the terminal completely
2. Open a new terminal
3. cd C:\Users\nakap\Desktop\dealership-audit-mvp  (in PowerShell)
   OR
   cd /mnt/c/Users/nakap/Desktop/dealership-audit-mvp  (in WSL)
4. npm start
5. Try: http://localhost:3002/settings-config

The issue is your server is running OLD code. A proper restart will fix this.
